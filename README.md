## Project Nudge

Nudge, our innovative web application, is designed with a singular mission: to revolutionize the way people of all ages and educational backgrounds engage with and comprehend complex concepts effectively and concisely. Rooted in the powerful Feynman technique, Nudge is not just a tool; **it's a learning companion that aspires to guide users through a journey of understanding within the framework of five carefully crafted questions.**

At its core, the Feynman technique is a proven learning methodology consisting of four transformative steps: selecting a concept, teaching it to a child, reviewing and refining understanding, and organizing notes for regular revisitation. Nudge takes inspiration from these steps, focusing primarily on the initial three to create an immersive learning experience.

The application invites users to input prompts on any given topic, and in return, it provides them with a thoughtful selection of five questions. These questions serve as prompts for users to articulate their understanding of the topic, fostering a deep and comprehensive grasp of the subject matter.

More than just a learning tool, Nudge is built on the fundamental belief that learning should be accessible, engaging, and tailored to individual needs. Whether you're a seasoned learner or just starting your educational journey, Nudge is here to empower you with a dynamic and personalized approach to understanding complex topics.

Embark on a learning adventure with Nudge, where the pursuit of knowledge is transformed into an enjoyable and enlightening experience.
